# Data Structure and Algorithm

Ah, DSA. The part of the Computer Science journey that everyone says is non-negotiable. 🙂 As a certified newbie, I'm taking their word for it!

I've created this repository to be my public diary of trying to make sense of it all. This is where I'll put everything I learn, from simple stacks to brain-melting graph theories. Expect some triumphs, some face-palms, and a whole lot of code. 😶‍🌫️


## The Secret Research Files

Want a peek behind the curtain? This folder holds all the evidence, notes, and frantic diagrams from my ongoing investigation into Data Structures and Algorithms. 🥶
